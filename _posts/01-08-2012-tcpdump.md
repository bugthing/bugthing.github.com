title: doing a dump... a nice big TCP one
---

Today I had to figure out why 1 certain SOAP script worked and another did not,
even thou they do look very simlar.

For this I used tcpdump .. a handy command line tool to capture natwork traffic.

There are loads of options, but this is what I used to capture tcp data from 
interface 'eth0' on ports 80 and 443 into a file 'test.pcap'

  sudo tcpdump -vv -w test.pcap -i eth0 tcp port 80 or 443

While this command was running I ran the SOAP scripts and then used wireshark 
to get a nice graphical interpretation of the captured data.
