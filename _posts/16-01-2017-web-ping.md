The question came up if our web server had some downtime during deploys.

A simple way to check this is to run following before and during a deploy and see if we spot any downtime

    while sleep 0.5; do curl -s --insecure -w '%{url_effective} \t - %{http_code} \t - %{time_total} \n' -o /dev/null https://api.ourapp.com/; done

We could build on this to store results for later analysis but to answer the question this was enough
