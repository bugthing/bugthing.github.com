title: Bye perl, hello ruby
---

Today I was thinking about changing my VPS to run on a pure ruby platform rather
than the pure perl platform I currently have setup.

When I say "pure" I dont that in a strict sense, in fact I don't mean pure at all,
I just mean that I use as much Perl as possible.. and that I want to swap out
the Perl parts for Ruby bits.

So first port of call is web services .. for Perl we have Plack in Ruby there is
Rack .. so first of all lets get a very simple rack app started by putting the 
following in a file called 'Rakefile'

    require 'rack'
    class TryRack
        def call(env)
            [200, {"Content-Type" => "text/plain"}, ["Hello world!"]]
        end
    end
    Rack::Handler::WEBrick.run( TryRack.new, :Port => 9000 )

Then I just run: rake

"Roberts ya muvas bruva", rack app is running :)

rackup the lines
================

Althou the rake task does work, rackup is the perfered way to get rack apps
running, so lets creating a file 'tryrack.ru', with following content:
   
  class TryRack
    def call(env)
      return [ 200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/html'}, ["clay finger!"] ]
    end
  end
  run TryRack.new 

Now I just run: rakeup tryrack.ru
