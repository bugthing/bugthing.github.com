title: Getting a view of a git repo
---

I use git like a noob but really like it. It is great improvement on Subversion
and I find so many features very helpful... cherry-pick, cheap branches, 
rebasing, bisect, etc. etc.

I like using it so much that now I work in a place that still uses svn, I 
create hassel for myself by using git-svn so I can use git ontop of svn... althou
I hear this is a better solution: 
  
  [SubGit](http://subgit.com/)

When I want to get a decent view on a git project, I might do something like this

    git log --graph --pretty="tformat:%C(yellow)%h%Creset %Cgreen(%ar)%Creset %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset %C(red)%d%Creset %s"

That outputs a nice colourful over view of recent actively on a project.

To see what has happend on a file (README in this case) in recent times, I 
might to this:

    git log --since='1 month ago' -- README
