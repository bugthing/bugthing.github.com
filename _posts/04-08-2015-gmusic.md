title: Use google music from the command line
---
I like google music its an inexpensive and reliable service with a fairly good collection of music and I can upload my collection too.

The biggest problem I saw with it is that I could only listen through a brower or my android device... until now..

I recently found (|https://github.com/diraimondo/gmusicproxy)[gmusicproxy] .. this sounded too good to be true!

After a fair bit of messing around trying to get it to work, I managed to get it working and am currently playing my collection from google music via **ncmpcpp** and **mpd**

I had a few bumps along the road, so here is what I did:

Install a local version of python
=================================

To not polute my system python and to install stuff without being root, install a local recent Python using pyenv.

See: (https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv)[https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv]

    $ git clone https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
    $ echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
    $ echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    $ source .bashrc
    $ pyenv install 2.7.10

Checkout latest code
====================

    $ git clone https://github.com/diraimondo/gmusicproxy.git
    $ cd ./gmusicproxy

Install it an depencys
======================

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Write config
============

    $ cat << EOF > ~/.config/gmusicproxy/gmusicproxy.cfg
    email=cto@gmail.com
    password=mysupapassword
    device-id=magicid
    extended-m3u=true
    EOF

Get Device ID's
===============

First off I just made up my device-id which was causing incorrect (403's from Google).
Does this for list of configured devices and use one of these.

    $ python GMusicProxy --config ~/.config/gmusicproxy/gmusicproxy.cfg --list-devices

Run it
======

    $ python GMusicProxy --config ~/.config/gmusicproxy/gmusicproxy.cfg

Use it
======

Use gmusicproxy to create playlists, which mpd can then read and play.. awesome!

    $ curl -s  'http://localhost:9999/get_collection' > ~/.config/mpd/playlists/collection_201507.m3u
