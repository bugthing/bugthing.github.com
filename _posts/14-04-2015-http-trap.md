title: Capture and print HTTP request
---

So I wanted to see what this app was exporting (http request wise), so I created the following Rack app to listen
on a given port, then I could capture and print what the app was posting

Installed `thin` as the webserver

    gem install thin

Write a simple rack app:

    require 'rack'

    module Rack
      class LogIt
        def initialize(app, options = {})
          @app = app
        end

        def call(env)
          r = Rack::Request.new(env)
          env.each_pair { |h,v| puts "#{h}: #{v}" }
          puts ''
          puts r.body.read
          @app.call env
        end
      end
    end

    app = Rack::Builder.new do
      use Rack::LogIt
      app = proc do |env|
        [ 200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, ["Hello!"] ]
      end
      run app
    end.to_app

    server =  Thin::Server.new('0.0.0.0','3009', app, {})
    server.start

Run like so:

    thin -R app.rb start
