title: Use sshuttle to create a VPN
---

So  I was running some end2end tests of a our software stack, part of which involved using
Selenium to register a user. The registeration process involved being sent an email that
contained a "confirmation" link.

We wrote so code to login into a gmail account to get hold of the sent registration email, but
one the tests were deployed gmail blocked us (as we were suddenly coming from another country)

I thought, no problem I'll to login into the account from my desktop going via an ssh tunnel
from machine that runs the tests ... but setting up an tunnel and making my browser use was
abit of mission .. enter "sshuttle"

A quick

    pacaur -S sshuttle

and I had the software on my machine.

Now I just use sshuttle and all traffic from my desktop goes via the machine I ssh'ed into

    sshuttle -r person@server 0/0 -vv


nice and simple
