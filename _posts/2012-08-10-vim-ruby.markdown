Since I was a introduced to linux development I have used 'vim' and have never
switched editors... you might think by now I would have very specialised vim config
but I basically made do with the defaults. (I do a few tweaks but nothing massive)

I have lately been trying out some plugins, seeing as I am moving over to trendy rails
developement, I thought I'd try 'vim-rails' plugin.

To achieve this I use a vim plugin manager called Vundle.

(Vundle)[https://github.com/gmarik/vundle]
(vim-rails)[https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails]

Compile a new vim
==================

It was all easy to install vim plugins from github, but I did find the version of vim I was using was
not compiled with ruby support. 

To do this I just checkout an new svn version:

    svn co https://vim.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vim/vim7

The configure like so:

    ./configure --prefix=/home/benjamin/build  --enable-rubyinterp    

The just add an alias to my .bashrc

    alias vim='~/build/bin/vim'

After compiling a new vim I discovered I could have just got everything from debian repos:

    apt-get install vim-nox vim-rails
