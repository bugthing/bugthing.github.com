Getting a new VPS all started when I noticed my current provider had a cheaper deal available
(that I was not on).

I tried to get my VSP changed, but they said I had to sign up for a new one, transfer everything
and cancel the old one... I tried that, but even thou I ask for a very simple VPS they gave
me an old (ish) ubuntu with Plask on etc.... so now I have 2 VPS at the same provider that
I am not that happy with.

I then happened to see a an add from Heart internet, I noticed in the VSP section they had 
a new Ubuntu to choose from (or even Debian 6) for an even cheaper price... so I used
the chat function on the site and got signed up a month with a minimal ubuntu 12.04 server.
.. now I have 3 VPS servers..

While messing about trying to put all my friends and my sites onto 1 server so I can 
cancel the other 2 I configured the following:

  * web server user
  * rbenv, perlbrew, php-cgi for web user
  * ssh key only access
  * firewall using ufw
  * gitolite
  * postfix to forward mail 
  * ruby/perl based http servers serving on local sockets
  * nginx to proxy web requests to local servers
  * vhosts init type script to start all the servers
  * vhosts/php-cgi init.d scripts
  * gitlab
