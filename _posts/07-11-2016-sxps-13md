title: XPS13 + Arch + updates = perfect linux laptop
---

My new job asked what laptop they should get me, I said the top spec XPS13 (9360) and the WD15 dock.

It was delivered to my house and in a couple of hours I had it setup with full disk encryption, full systemd
(mkincpio), btrfs, gnome, tmux, arch, etc. etc.

After I started and made use of dock which seemingly worked perfectly, I noticed the machine would freeze
once I had unplugged from the dock and plugged back in or if in when in suspend.

Now I have updated the BIO to 1.0.7, it seems to be working well.

I installed the update by copying the .exe file into my efi partition, hitting F12 during boot and selecting
the BIO update option
